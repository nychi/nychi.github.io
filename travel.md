The hackathon is being held at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, NY.  It will be held in the Low Center for Industrial Innovation (CII).  It is Building 14 on [this map](http://rpi.edu/tour/zoomify/). 

If you are able to provide your own transportation, here are your options:

-Flying: You can fly in to Albany Airport (ALB).  The airport is about 15 minutes from campus.  From there you can take a taxi to our campus.
-Train or Bus: You can take the train or bus to the Rensselaer-Albany Amtrak station.  The station is about 20 minutes from campus and you can then take a taxi to campus. 
-Driving: Use GPS instructions to get to the intersection of 11th street and Sage Avenue in Troy, NY 12180.  That will take you to a parking lot that is open on weekends.  You can park in this lot and then walk over to the CII.  The parking lot is listed on the map linked above as North Lot.
