Do you want to be a student mentor or volunteer for NY&chi;? No previous experience is required, just a desire to have a good time and be a part of the awesome event. You can assist by helping us during the event (e.g., food setup, etc).  We are also looking for volunteers to give tech talks, research talks, or technical tutorials.
If you're interested in volunteering with NY&chi; in any way, please contact us at <acmw@union.rpi.edu>!
