# Adding Content

There are two types of content: pages and annoucments.

Annoucments are also called "posts" in the jekyll.
They go in the `_posts` folder and should have a filename with datestamp (see the [Jekyll Post Documentation](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/)).

Pages get automatically added to the navigation menu at the top.

The idea is that the pages are decided ahead of time, while annousements happen as the conference is finalized and run.

# Design
