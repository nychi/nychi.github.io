Welcome to the first ever NY Capital Hackathon for Inclusivity: NY&chi;! (pronounced NY Chi)
We will be hosting a 2-day hackathon for women (cis and trans) and genderqueer students in the New York Capital Region.

The goal of this hackathon is to provide a safe environment for our attendees to discuss issues relevant to the gender gap prevalent in academia and the greater technology industry as a whole.  By focusing on women and genderqueer students for our event, we hope to instill confidence in our attendees and cultivate community among underrepresented groups within the Capital Region; ultimately creating a more inclusive tech industry further in the future.  

- **Who:** All high school, undergraduate, and graduate women (cis and trans) and genderqueer students in the Capital District Region
- **When:** April 16&ndash;17, 2016
- **Where:** Low Center for Industrial Innovation (CII), Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY.
