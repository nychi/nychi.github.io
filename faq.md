# FAQ

**WHAT IS NY&chi;?**

Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute’s inaugural women in tech summit, NY&chi;, will take place April 16 - 17th starting at 9:00am. We hope this event will bring together women in CS throughout the Capital District Region while also engaging them intellectually with the conference and a hackathon. You don’t need to be veteran hacker to participate! Any woman interested in programming, hackathons, or networking is highly encouraged to attend.

**Can I attend?**

Do you identify as a woman (cis or trans) or genderqueer? Do you attend school in the Capital Region? Do you love (or are interested in) tech? If you answered yes then you are more than welcome to attend! All skill levels are encouraged to attend!

**What’s the cost of attendance?**

Nothing! Admission is free and includes food, drinks, overnight hosting and tons of swag thanks to the generosity of our sponsors: NCWIT (Sponsored by Google.org) and RedHat.

**Is transportation provided?**

We will be offering transportation to the area universities.  Right now we will be providing stops at Union, Skidmore, UAlbany, Siena, St. Rose, and Sage.  As the event draws closer, we will be updating the site with more information as well as emailing participants about transportation.  

**What’s there to eat?**

Food will be provided for all meals throughout the duration of the event starting with breakfast on Saturday morning. If you have dietary restrictions please inform us in your registration and we will do our very best to accommodate them.

**Where can I sleep?**

Every hacker is different: some love to hack through the night while others prefer a power nap and we understand this! There will be designated quiet destinations for you to relax though we recommend bringing a sleeping bag or a pillow and blanket.

**What should I bring?**

Valid Student ID to verify registration, Government Issued ID, a laptop/charger, Pillow & Blanket, and Toiletries. For everything else, we got you covered!

**What if I have a question not covered by the FAQ?**

Email us! We would be more than happy to find the answers that you are looking for.
