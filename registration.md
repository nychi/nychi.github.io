Update 4/6/16: If you did not register before April 6th and you attend a Capital Region school, we may be unable to provide you with transportation to the hackathon. Please email us at <acmw@union.rpi.edu>. We have finalized transportation at this point, so check with us to see if we are able to provide transportation for you.

If you would like to register for NY&chi;, please fill out [this form](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ny-new-york-capital-hackathon-for-inclusivity-tickets-24264378409).

We've had to change our registration form and are no longer able to collect CV/resume in the form.  [Please share your CV/resume with us here.](https://www.dropbox.com/request/3o5QaZTBC7PxXzf0fsCq)

We participate in Major League Hacking (MLH) as a MLH Member Event. You authorize us to share certain application/registration information for event administration, ranking, MLH administration, and occasional messages about hackathons in line with the [MLH Privacy Policy](http://mlh.io/privacy).
